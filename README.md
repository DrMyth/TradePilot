# TradePilot MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server built with Python to enable AI LLMs (such as Claude AI) to trade using the MetaTrader 5 platform. This project exposes a comprehensive set of trading and market data functions, allowing natural language and programmatic control over trading operations.


## Features

- **Natural Language Trading:** Integrate with AI LLMs to place, manage, and analyze trades using plain English.
- **MetaTrader 5 Integration:** Direct connection to MT5 for real-time trading, order management, and account monitoring.
- **Gemini-2.0-flash Support:** Leverage Google’s advanced model for richer conversations.
- **Comprehensive API:** Exposes market data, trading, account, and historical functions for advanced automation and analytics.
- **Extensible & Modular:** Easily add new strategies or extend existing functionality.
- **User-Friendly:** Designed for both novice and experienced traders.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DrMyth/TradePilot.git
cd TradePilot
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

On Windows:
```powershell
uv venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

On Linux/macOS (assuming bash/zsh):
```bash
uv venv
.venv/Scripts/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

### 4. Running the MCP Client with Gemini-2.0-flash
Interactive CLI Client: Launch a REPL powered by Gemini‑2.0‑flash to execute natural‑language trading commands (e.g. “Place a buy order…” or “Show my open positions”).
1. Edit `src/config.json` to point at your MCP server endpoint and credentials.
2. Run the client:

   ```bash
   uv run src/client.py
   ```

### 5. Running the Server (Debug/Development)

```bash
mcp run src/main.py
```

This command starts the MCP server and makes all trading and market‑data functions available. You can reach the server at https://localhost:6274.

## Integration with Cursor IDE or Claude AI

To integrate this MCP server with AI tools like Cursor IDE or Claude AI, use the following configuration (example):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "TradePilot": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/uv/.local/bin/uv.exe",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/absolute/path/to/TradePilot/src/main.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/absolute/path/to/TradePilot/src"
      }
    }
